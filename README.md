# QtSongApp
Using Qt GUIs and event driven programming to build a song app in Qt.

All the necessary details regarding the code are provided in the requirement pictures and in comments next to the code.

TO RUN THE PROJECT, create a qt project in a C++ IDE, I recommend Visual Studio Community or C Lion (you will also need the Qt extension). Copy all the headers (.h) ,cpp (.cpp) files + fisier.txt and after that run the main.cpp. Here are some tutorials to help you link the Qt application to Visual Studio:

If you have other IDE or you need help, I recommend you to search for youtube tutorials.
